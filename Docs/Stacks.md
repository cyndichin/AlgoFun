# Stacks Data Structure
- A **stack** is a data structure in which an item is added, it is placed on top of the stack and when an item is removed, you remove the top-most item.
- Enforces how you access your data
- Last In, First Out (LIFO)
- Real Life Examples: pancakes, books, paper, cash

## Operations
- **push**: adding an element to the top of the stack
- **pop**: removing the top element of the stack

## Use Case
- navigation stack in iOS to push and pop view controllers into / out of view
- memory allocation at the architectural level such as memory for local variables are managed on the stack
- search and conquer algorithms (finding a path out of a maze, facilitate backtracking)
